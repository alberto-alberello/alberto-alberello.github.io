## My research

I research geophysical fluid dynamics problems and interactions at the air--sea--ice interface combining theoretical, numerical and physical modelling as well as conducting field measurements.

### Marginal ice zone processes
wave dissipation, sea ice drift, wave induced breakup, floe size distribution.

### Nonlinear ocean wave dynamics
wave turbulence, rogue wave statistics, wave induced kinematics, wave induced turbulence and wave-structure interaction.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alberto-alberello/research/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alberto-alberello/research/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
