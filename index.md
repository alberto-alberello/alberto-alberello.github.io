Researh fellow in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/mathematical-sciences/) ([University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/)) and part of the dynamics, modelling and computation group ([DMC](https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/research-impact/dynamics-modelling-and-computation)).
I investigate geophysical fluid dynamics problems and interactions at the air--sea--ice interface combining theoretical, numerical and physical modelling as well as conducting field measurements.

__Marginal ice zone processes__:sea ice drift, wave dissipation, wave induced breakup, floe size distribution.

__Nonlinear ocean wave dynamics__:wave turbulence, rogue wave statistics, wave induced kinematics, wave induced turbulence and wave-structure interaction.
